# HIVE and PIG

For this Lab, we will use the MovieLens Small Dataset to examine the functions
of HIVE and PIG. Both of these applications can either run on top of a working
HDFS / Mapreduce cluster, or they can run in local mode.

# Tasks


1. Install Pig <https://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.15.0/start.html>
(Optionally, install Hadoop / HDFS and Copy the source files to the HDFS)

1. Install Hive
   <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted>

1. Obtain the MovieLens Latest Small dataset
<http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/>

1. Load the MovieLens Dataset files with pig and then query them with Hive
    1. With pig, you will need to split the genres, correlate the ratings and
       decide which files to merge or not
    1. Example Hive Query: Title of the Top-rated Action / Comedy movie?
    1. Example Hive Query: Title of the user with the highest average rating?

Read the <http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small-README.html>
for the details of how the files are organised.
